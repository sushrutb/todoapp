<h3>About</h3>
<p>
	Managing information and tasks is a difficult problem. I think no single tool available does this elegantly. I built Simplycious to solve this problem, at least for myself.
</p>
<p>
	We consume lot of information and content. Certain part of it is useful which we would like to record and use it afterwards. It can be as simple as bookmarking some article, quote from a book, link to a recipe or news about your competitor.
</p>
<p>
	Simplycious is built in a way that, it lets you record/save any type of information you want and then easily find that. I use it to keep track of my daily tasks (except meetings), bookmarks, reading list, movies I want to see. I keep track of new and interesting products/startups in India.
</p>
<p>
	Simplycious does not get in the way of use. You can use it any way you want. It does not force you to adapt some methodolgy or terse syntax either. Just keep saving information as would normally do.
</p>
